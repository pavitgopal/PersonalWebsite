            <div class="ta-position">
                <h3>The following prompt was entered into Chat GPT to create the University Involvement page of this website!</h3>
                <p>"Develop a page called university involvement using html and css. This page needs to have a nav bar with the home page, portfolio ,qualifications, service, and THIS university involvement page. I want the top of the header to say MEET Pavithra Gopalakrishnan where MEET is on the left and Pavithra Gopalakrishnan is broken up across two lines that are equal in height to MEET and right next to it (on the same row). On the right of this should be a circular profile image. This all needs to be centered on the header. Below that needs to be the nav bar. This entire section needs to be highlighted lavender with the text being a darker shade of lavender. Meanwhile for the footer, we need images linked to github, lisntagram, linkdin, and facebook. This section should also be lavender in background and the page should be scrollable. For the actual body of the page, there should be a main header called University Involvement and subheaders labeled student organizations and TA position. The main header should be half highlighted in purple. Meanwhile, for student organizations, create sections for Society of Women Engineers with a picture underneath, Aggie Coding club, Aggie Women in computer science also with a picture underneath, and Student Engineers Council. Under each of these just place filler text to be completed later. Under TA position, have a subheader called 222 Discrete mathematics TA and have a filler text underneath. The files tructure of this is one html page and one css page."</p>
